# Explanation Enhanced Graph Learning (EEGL)

EEGL is an iterative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by mining frequent subgraphs from GNN explanations and feeding them back as additional node features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management
- `gcc`, `make`, `wget`, and `patch` to build third-party tooling such as [Gaston](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~nijssensgr/gaston/)
- A CUDA-capable GPU for GPU-backed experiments (optional, but recommended)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) or Docker for container-based workflows

The repository also includes prebuilt Glasgow Subgraph Solver binaries under `external/` for supported platforms.

## Setup

### Local development

Create or refresh the default environment:

```sh
make env
```

To view all available Makefile commands at any time:

```sh
make help
```

This runs `uv sync` and creates `.venv/` if needed.

Install the Gaston frequent subgraph miner:

```sh
make gaston
```

If you only need runtime dependencies, install the non-development set with:

```sh
make deps
```

### Dev container (VS Code)

Open the repository in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** when prompted. The dev container builds from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and runs `uv sync` automatically.

### Manual container workflow

```sh
make docker-build
make docker-run
make docker-login
```

The container helper uses Podman when available and falls back to Docker otherwise.

## Quick start

Run the bundled demo workflow:

```sh
make run-demo
```

This launches [workflows/run.py](workflows/run.py) with [run_configs/dev.yml](run_configs/dev.yml) and [run_configs/run_defaults.yml](run_configs/run_defaults.yml).

To preprocess fullerene data into pickled graphs:

```sh
make process-fullerenes
```

The default output location is `dataset/pickled/fullerenes`.

## Interactive tools

- `make jupyter` starts JupyterLab on port `8080`
- `make marimo` starts a Marimo lab server on port `8080`
- `make voila` starts Voilà on port `8866`
- `make nb-clean` clears output cells from changed notebooks

`make jupyter-clean` and `make notebook-clean` are aliases for `make nb-clean`.
